# knapsack-msga
This' my project in class. Knapsack 0-1 implemented with Genetic Algorithm. Usually, Greedy Algorithm implements the Knapsack 0-1 Problem. But i want to be faster, so i try to use Mixed Strategy Genetic Algorithm. For the genetic operators, i'll use bitwise mutation and one-point crossover. If you wanna know it, just keep coding ;)
